Android is a Linux-based operating system designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices
such as smartphones and tablet computers, developed by Google in conjunction with the Open
Handset Alliance. Initially developed by Android Inc, whom Google financially backed and
later purchased. Android was unveiled along with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance,
a consortium of 86 hardware, software, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing
open standards for mobile devices. Google releases the Android code as open source,
under the Apache License. The Android Open Source Project, led by Google, is tasked with the
maintenance and further development of Android. Additionally, Android has a large community
of developers writing applications that extend the functionality of devices, written
primarily in a customized version of Java. They are available for download through Google Play
or third-party sites.
